<h1>HTML AND THE INTERNET</h1>
<b>Two Main Topics</b>
<br><b>Overview of the Internet</b>:</br><br>The big-picture view of how the internet works and introduced to terms like servers, browsers, the internet, and HTTP.<br>
<br><b>Introduction to HTML</b></br><br>Introduced to HTML tags and saw how even though these tags aren't visible to users of a web page, they still carry meaning that<em> is </em>meaningful to web browsers.</br>
<br><b>The five most <em>important</em> things to take from this lesson are the following:</b></br>
<br><b>1.What a Web Page is:</b></br>
<p>A web page is a text document written in a language called HTML. Web browsers read these documents, and then interpret and display them.</p>
<b>2. How Coding Works</b>
<p>Coding happens when programmers write text in a language that a computer can understand. The computer can then follow the instructions the programmer wrote.</p> 
<b>3 - Computers are Stupid</b>
<p>Programmers need to write exactly the way a computer understands (also known as writing with correct "syntax"). 
For example, if you forget to close a tag, the computer won't be able to figure out what you had intended to make bold. This <em>stupidity</em> can be very frustrating, but it also gives programmers incredible power: if you know how to talk to a computer than you can tell it do do anything you want.</p>
<b>4 - Programmers Can't Remember Everything</b>
<p>There are too many details to keep everything in your head. And that's okay. If you forget how to make text <em>italic</em> in HTML, you can always just look it up.</p>
<b>5 - Basic HTML Vocabulary</b>
<p>Tag: An HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets. Most tags have an opening tag and a closing tag,. Some tags (called "void" tags) do not require a closing tag like a br tag)
Element: An HTML element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.
Attribute: This is a property of an HTML element that examples can be found at the URL <a href="www.udacity.com">Udacity</a></p>
